Synchronous serial link (useful for audio transmission from PC):
http://masteringarduino.blogspot.ru/2013/11/USART.html
Set serial on atmega328p this way:
UCSRC = (1 << UMSEL); //setting the UMSEL bit to 1 for synchronous mode
//XCK pin (PD.4, pin#6 of ATmega328)
//do not set the U2X bit of UCSRA register?
??? |= (1 << DDR_XCK); // search DDR_XCK in manual - link to manual on above blogspot page

HINT: if things will not work properly,
try to put led on some digital output and turn it on where base_station_was_powered_on
is checked to be 1 during transition to on-line and turn it off when base_station_was_powered_on
is checeked to be 0 during transition to off-line; and try to enable pullup mode on PD2
