when you will integrate snd/ here, where interrupts are used, do not use interrupt for keydetect - use mechanism similar to XXXI - see usb/README.ISR - i.e., use polling, not interrupt, and use latch to indicate that value has been seen (see MT8870 datasheet and MT8870-Schematic-Diagram.pdf - you will have to tinker with DTMF board - St/GT and ESt must be de-coupled not to automatically return StD to low - this must be done manually from MCU
