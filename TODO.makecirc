after converting to TeX from LaTeX,
use "input TEX" instead of "input latex", and change latex() to TEX(),
and in latex.mp change latex() to TEX(), and do so that TEXPRE will
be used in latex.mp instead of LaTeXsetup, and while drawing change
"input TEX" to "input latex" and use double compilation

try to use btex/etex directly in "transistor" call (and others)? then external processing will not be necessary?
