@ Add led between ground and PB6 (via 330 ohm resistor).

Button press indication LED is used without interrupts and timers, because
we block the program anyway inside the debounce interval, so use that to turn
the LED off.

Take to consideration that:

\item{1.} \\{ioctl} call blocks in application until it is
read in this program
\item{2.} data is read by USB host as soon as it is sent, even if \\{read}
call has not been done in application yet (i.e., it is buffered)

`\.B' and `\.C' are compensation for DTMF features absent in matrix:
We set debounce delay and thus cannot increase volume quickly, whereas
in DTMF pulse duration is permitted to be short.

TODO: increase debounce on A? This is useful when we switch off (when done with a router) and
then immediately switch on to go to another router - for this maybe use separate
button to go off-line instead of pressing A second time (for this
do not use saying time in ru and in fr - and use button B to go
off-line, and use C and D for volume (as B
and C now) and switch off all routers manually)

NOTE: if necessary, you may set 16-bit timers here as if interrupts are not
enabled at all (if USB RESET interrupt happens, device is going to be reset anyway,
so it is safe that it is enabled (we cannot disable it because USB host may be
rebooted)
NOTE: if you decide to do keypress indication via timer, keep in mind that keypress
indication timeout
must not increase debounce delay (so that when next key is pressed, the timer is guaranteed
to expire - before it is set again)

@ The pull-up resistor is connected to the high voltage (this is usually 3.3V or 5V and is
often refereed to as VCC).

Pull-ups are often used with buttons and switches.

With a pull-up resistor, the input pin will read a high state when the photo-transistor
is not opened. In other words, a small amount of current is flowing between VCC and the input
pin (not to ground), thus the input pin reads close to VCC. When the photo-transistor is
opened, it connects the input pin directly to ground. The current flows through the resistor
to ground, thus the input pin reads a low state.

Since pull-up resistors are so commonly needed, our MCU has internal pull-ups
that can be enabled and disabled.

@ Used in USB\_RESET interrupt handler.
Reset is used to go to beginning of connection loop (because we cannot
use \&{goto} from within interrupt handler). Watchdog reset is used because
in atmega32u4 there is no simpler way to reset MCU.

@<Reset MCU@>=
WDTCSR |= 1 << WDCE | 1 << WDE; /* allow to enable WDT */
WDTCSR = 1 << WDE; /* enable WDT */
while (1) ;

@ When reset is done via watchdog, WDRF (WatchDog Reset Flag) is set in MCUSR register.
WDE (WatchDog system reset Enable) is always set in WDTCSR when WDRF is set. It
is necessary to clear WDE to stop MCU from eternal resetting:
on MCU start we always clear |WDRF| and WDE
(nothing will change if they are not set).
To avoid unintentional changes of WDE, a special write procedure must be followed
to change the WDE bit. To clear WDE, WDRF must be cleared first.

Datasheet says that |WDE| is always set to one when |WDRF| is set to one,
but it does not say if |WDE| is always set to zero when |WDRF| is not set
(by default it is zero).
So we must always clear |WDE| independent of |WDRF|.

This should be done right at the beginning of |main|, in order to be in
time before WDT is triggered.
We don't call \\{wdt\_reset} because initialization code,
that \.{avr-gcc} adds, has enough time to execute before watchdog
timer (16ms in this program) expires:

$$\vbox{\halign{\tt#\cr
  eor r1, r1 (1 cycle)\cr
  out 0x3f, r1 (1 cycle)\cr
  ldi r28, 0xFF (1 cycle)\cr
  ldi r29, 0x0A (1 cycle)\cr
  out 0x3e, r29 (1 cycle)\cr
  out 0x3d, r28 (1 cycle)\cr
  call <main> (4 cycles)\cr
}}$$

At 16MHz each cycle is 62.5 nanoseconds, so it is 7 instructions,
taking 10 cycles, multiplied by 62.5 is 625 nanoseconds.

What the above code does: zero r1 register, clear SREG, initialize program stack
(to the stack processor writes addresses for returning from subroutines and interrupt
handlers). To the stack pointer is written address of last cell of RAM.

Note, that ns is $10^{-9}$, $\mu s$ is $10^{-6}$ and ms is $10^{-3}$.

@ A high-speed capable device that has different device information for full-speed and high-speed
must have a Device Qualifier Descriptor. For example, if the device is currently operating at
full-speed, the Device Qualifier returns information about how it would operate at high-speed and
vice-versa. So as this device is full-speed, it tells the host not to request
device information for high-speed by using ``protocol stall'' (such stall
does not indicate an error with the device ---~it serves as a means of
extending USB requests).

The host sends an IN token to the control pipe to initiate the DATA stage.

difference of clearing TXINI for control and non-control endpoint is that
on control endpoint clearing TXINI also sends the packet and clears the endpoint bank.
On non-control endpoints there is a possibility to have double bank, so another
mechanism is used.}

@* Control endpoint management.
(WARNING: these images are incomplete --- they do not show possible handshake
phases)

Device driver sends a
packet to device's EP0. As the data is flowing out from the host, it will end
up in the EP0 buffer. Firmware will then at its leisure read this data. If it
wants to return data, the device cannot simply
write to the bus as the bus is controlled by the host.
Therefore it writes data to EP0 which sits in the buffer
until such time when the host sends a IN packet requesting the
data.\footnote*{This is where the prase ``USB controller has
to manage simultaneous write requests from firmware and host'' from \S22.12.2 of
datasheet becomes clear. (Remember, we use one and the same
endpoint to read {\it and\/} write control data.)}

(see \S22.12.1 in datasheet): If TXINI is already cleared when IN packet arrives, NAKINI is not
set. This corresponds to case 1. If TXINI is not yet cleared when IN packet arrives, NAKINI
is set. This corresponds to case 2.

@*1 Configuration descriptor.

Abstract Control Model consists of two interfaces: Data Class interface
and Communication Class interface.

The Communication Class interface uses two endpoints\footnote*{Although
CDC spec says that notification endpoint is optional, in Linux host
driver refuses to work without it.}, one to implement
a notification element and theh other to implement
a management element. The management element uses the default endpoint
for all standard and Communication Class-specific requests.

Theh Data Class interface consists of two endpoints to implement
channels over which to carry data.

@*2 Functional descriptors.

These descriptors describe the content of the class-specific information
within an Interface descriptor. They all start with a common header
descriptor, which allows host software to easily parse the contents of
class-specific descriptors. Although the
Communication Class currently defines class specific interface descriptor
information, the Data Class does not.

\S5.2.3 in CDC spec.

@*3 Header functional descriptor.

The class-specific descriptor shall start with a header.
It identifies the release of the USB Class Definitions for
Communication Devices Specification with which this
interface and its descriptors comply.

@*3 Abstract control management functional descriptor.

The Abstract Control Management functional descriptor
describes the commands supported by the Communication
Class interface, as defined in \S3.6.2 in CDC spec, with the
SubClass code of Abstract Control Model.

@<Class-specific interface descriptor 2@>=
struct {
  U8 bFunctionLength;
  U8 bDescriptorType;
  U8 bDescriptorSubtype;
  U8 bmCapabilities;
}

@ |bmCapabilities|: Only first four bits are used.
If first bit is set, then this indicates the device
supports the request combination of \.{Set\_Comm\_Feature},
\.{Clear\_Comm\_Feature}, and \.{Get\_Comm\_Feature}.
If second bit is set, then the device supports the request
combination of \.{Set\_Line\_Coding}, \.{Set\_Control\_Line\_State},
\.{Get\_Line\_Coding}, and the notification \.{Serial\_State}.
If the third bit is set, then the device supports the request
\.{Send\_Break}. If fourth bit is set, then the device
supports the notification \.{Network\_Connection}.
A bit value of zero means that the request is not supported.

}

@*3 Union functional descriptor.

The Union functional descriptor describes the relationship between
a group of interfaces that can be considered to form
a functional unit. One of the interfaces in
the group is designated as a master or controlling interface for
the group, and certain class-specific messages can be
sent to this interface to act upon the group as a whole. Similarly,
notifications for the entire group can be sent from this
interface but apply to the entire group of interfaces.

  0x03, /* type (string) */
@t\2@> 0x09,0x04 /* id (English) */
};

@*1 String descriptors.

The trick here is that when defining a variable of type |S_string_descriptor|,
the string content follows the first two elements in program memory.
The C standard says that a flexible array member in a struct does not increase the size of the
struct (aside from possibly adding some padding at the end) but gcc lets you initialize it anyway.
|sizeof| on the variable counts only first two elements.
So, we read the size of the variable at
execution time in |@<Handle {\caps get descriptor string} (manufacturer)@>|
and |@<Handle {\caps get descriptor string} (product)@>| by using |pgm_read_byte|.

TODO: put here explanation from \.{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51470592/}
@^TODO@>

Is USB each character is 2 bytes. Wide-character string can be used here,
because on GCC for atmega32u4 wide character is 2 bytes.
Note, that for wide-character string I use type `\&{int}', not `\&{wchar\_t}',
because by `\&{wchar\_t}' I always mean 4 bytes (to avoid using `\&{wint\_t}').

This one is different in that its content cannot be prepared in compile time,
only in execution time. So, it cannot be stored in program memory.
Therefore, a special trick is used in |send_descriptor| (to avoid cluttering it with
arguments): we pass a null pointer if serial number is to be transmitted.
In |send_descriptor| |sn_desc| is filled in.

A is input and  C1 ... Cn are outputs.
We "turn on" one of C1, C2, ... Cn at a time by connecting it to ground inside the chip
(i.e., setting it to logic zero).
Other pins of C1, C2, ... Cn are not connected anywhere at that time.
The current will always flow into the pin which is connected to ground.
The current has to flow into your transmitter for the receiver to be able to tell it's a zero.
Now when the switch connected to this output pin is pressed, the input A
is pulled to ground through the switch, and its state becomes zero.
Pressing other switches doesn't change anything, since their other pins
are not connected to ground. When we want to read another switch, we
change the output pin which is connected to ground, so that always
just one of them is set like that.

To set output pin, do this:
|DDRx.y = 1|.
To unset output pin, do this;
|DDRx.y = 0|.

@ Delay to eliminate capacitance on the wire which may be open-ended on
the side of input pin (i.e., when button is not pressed), and capacitance
on the longer wire (i.e., when button is pressed).

To adjust the number of no-ops, remove all no-ops from here,
then do this: 1)\footnote*{In contrast with usual \\{\_delay\_us(1)}, here we need
to use minimum possible delay because it is done repeatedly.}
If symbol(s) will appear by themselves (FIXME: under which conditions?),
add one no-op. Repeat until this does not happen. 2) If
symbol does not appear after pressing a key, add one no-op.
Repeat until this does not happen.

FIXME: maybe do |_delay_us(1);| in |@<Pullup input pins@>| and use only 2) here?
(and then change references to this section from everywhere)

one more way to test: use |@<Get button@>| in a `|while (1) ... _delay_us(1);|' loop
and when you detect a certain button, after a debounce delay (via |i++; ... if (i<delay) ...|),
check if btn==0 in the cycle and if yes, turn on led - while you are holding the button,
led must not turn on - if it does, add nop's

NOTE: in above methods add some more nops after testing to depass border state

FIXME: maybe just use |_delay_us(1);| instead of adjustments with nop's
