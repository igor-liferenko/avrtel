@* Program.
DTR is used by \.{tel} to switch the phone off (on timeout and for
special commands) by switching off/on
base station for one second (the phone looses connection to base
station and automatically powers itself off).

\.{tel} uses DTR to switch on base station when it starts;
and when TTY is closed, DTR switches off base station.

The main requirement to the phone is that base station
must have led indicator\footnote*{For
some phone models when base station is powered on, the indicator is turned
on for a short time. In such case use \.{avrtel-poweron.ch}.}
for on-hook / off-hook on base station (to be able
to reset to initial state in state machine in \.{tel}; note, that
measuring voltage drop in phone line to determine hook state does not work
reliably, because it
falsely triggers when dtmf signal is produced ---~the dtmf signal is alternating
below the trigger level and multiple on-hook/off-hook events occur in high
succession).

Note, that relay switches off output from base station's power supply, not input
because transition processes from 220v could damage power supply because it
is switched on/off multiple times.

Also note that when device is not plugged in,
base station must be powered off, and it must be powered on by \.{tel} (this
is why non-inverted relay must be used (and from such kind of relay the
only suitable I know of is mechanical relay; and such relay gives an advantage
that power supply with AC and DC output may be used; however, see {\tt
TLP281.tex} how to fix TLP281 to make it behave like
normally-open-mechanical-relay)).
If base station
is powered when device is not plugged in, this breaks program logic badly.

%Note, that we can not use simple cordless phone---a DECT phone is needed, because
%resetting base station to put the phone on-hook will not work
%(FIXME: check if it is really so).

@ The pull-up resistor is connected to the high voltage (this is usually 3.3V or 5V and is
often refereed to as VCC).

Pull-ups are often used with buttons and switches.

With a pull-up resistor, the input pin will read a high state when the photo-transistor
is not opened. In other words, a small amount of current is flowing between VCC and the input
pin (not to ground), thus the input pin reads close to VCC. When the photo-transistor is
opened, it connects the input pin directly to ground. The current flows through the resistor
to ground, thus the input pin reads a low state.

Since pull-up resistors are so commonly needed, our MCU has internal pull-ups
that can be enabled and disabled.

@ Used in USB\_RESET interrupt handler.
Reset is used to go to beginning of connection loop (because we cannot
use \&{goto} from within interrupt handler). Watchdog reset is used because
in atmega32u4 there is no simpler way to reset MCU.

@<Reset MCU@>=
WDTCSR |= 1 << WDCE | 1 << WDE; /* allow to enable WDT */
WDTCSR = 1 << WDE; /* enable WDT */
while (1) ;

@ When reset is done via watchdog, WDRF (WatchDog Reset Flag) is set in MCUSR register.
WDE (WatchDog system reset Enable) is always set in WDTCSR when WDRF is set. It
is necessary to clear WDE to stop MCU from eternal resetting:
on MCU start we always clear |WDRF| and WDE
(nothing will change if they are not set).
To avoid unintentional changes of WDE, a special write procedure must be followed
to change the WDE bit. To clear WDE, WDRF must be cleared first.

Datasheet says that |WDE| is always set to one when |WDRF| is set to one,
but it does not say if |WDE| is always set to zero when |WDRF| is not set
(by default it is zero).
So we must always clear |WDE| independent of |WDRF|.

This should be done right at the beginning of |main|, in order to be in
time before WDT is triggered.
We don't call \\{wdt\_reset} because initialization code,
that \.{avr-gcc} adds, has enough time to execute before watchdog
timer (16ms in this program) expires:

$$\vbox{\halign{\tt#\cr
  eor r1, r1 (1 cycle)\cr
  out 0x3f, r1 (1 cycle)\cr
  ldi r28, 0xFF (1 cycle)\cr
  ldi r29, 0x0A (1 cycle)\cr
  out 0x3e, r29 (1 cycle)\cr
  out 0x3d, r28 (1 cycle)\cr
  call <main> (4 cycles)\cr
}}$$

At 16MHz each cycle is 62.5 nanoseconds, so it is 7 instructions,
taking 10 cycles, multiplied by 62.5 is 625 nanoseconds.

What the above code does: zero r1 register, clear SREG, initialize program stack
(to the stack processor writes addresses for returning from subroutines and interrupt
handlers). To the stack pointer is written address of last cell of RAM.

Note, that ns is $10^{-9}$, $\mu s$ is $10^{-6}$ and ms is $10^{-3}$.

@ A high-speed capable device that has different device information for full-speed and high-speed
must have a Device Qualifier Descriptor. For example, if the device is currently operating at
full-speed, the Device Qualifier returns information about how it would operate at high-speed and
vice-versa. So as this device is full-speed, it tells the host not to request
device information for high-speed by using ``protocol stall'' (such stall
does not indicate an error with the device ---~it serves as a means of
extending USB requests).

The host sends an IN token to the control pipe to initiate the DATA stage.

@*1 Configuration descriptor.

Abstract Control Model consists of two interfaces: Data Class interface
and Communication Class interface.

The Communication Class interface uses two endpoints\footnote*{Although
CDC spec says that notification endpoint is optional, in Linux host
driver refuses to work without it.}, one to implement
a notification element and theh other to implement
a management element. The management element uses the default endpoint
for all standard and Communication Class-specific requests.

Theh Data Class interface consists of two endpoints to implement
channels over which to carry data.

@*2 Functional descriptors.

These descriptors describe the content of the class-specific information
within an Interface descriptor. They all start with a common header
descriptor, which allows host software to easily parse the contents of
class-specific descriptors. Although the
Communication Class currently defines class specific interface descriptor
information, the Data Class does not.

\S5.2.3 in CDC spec.

@*3 Header functional descriptor.

The class-specific descriptor shall start with a header.
It identifies the release of the USB Class Definitions for
Communication Devices Specification with which this
interface and its descriptors comply.

\S5.2.3.1 in CDC spec.

@<Class-specific interface descriptor 1@>=
struct {
  U8 bFunctionLength;
  U8 bDescriptorType;
  U8 bDescriptorSubtype;
  U16 bcdCDC;
}

@ @<Initialize element 3 in configuration descriptor@>= { @t\1@> @/
  5, /* size of this structure */
  0x24, /* interface */
  0x00, /* header */
@t\2@> 0x0110 /* CDC 1.1 */
}

@*3 Abstract control management functional descriptor.

The Abstract Control Management functional descriptor
describes the commands supported by the Communication
Class interface, as defined in \S3.6.2 in CDC spec, with the
SubClass code of Abstract Control Model.

\S5.2.3.3 in CDC spec.

@<Class-specific interface descriptor 2@>=
struct {
  U8 bFunctionLength;
  U8 bDescriptorType;
  U8 bDescriptorSubtype;
  U8 bmCapabilities;
}

@ |bmCapabilities|: Only first four bits are used.
If first bit is set, then this indicates the device
supports the request combination of \.{Set\_Comm\_Feature},
\.{Clear\_Comm\_Feature}, and \.{Get\_Comm\_Feature}.
If second bit is set, then the device supports the request
combination of \.{Set\_Line\_Coding}, \.{Set\_Control\_Line\_State},
\.{Get\_Line\_Coding}, and the notification \.{Serial\_State}.
If the third bit is set, then the device supports the request
\.{Send\_Break}. If fourth bit is set, then the device
supports the notification \.{Network\_Connection}.
A bit value of zero means that the request is not supported.

  4, /* size of this structure */
  0x24, /* interface */
  0x02, /* ACM */
@t\2@> 1 << 2 | 1 << 1 @/
}

@*3 Union functional descriptor.

The Union functional descriptor describes the relationship between
a group of interfaces that can be considered to form
a functional unit. One of the interfaces in
the group is designated as a master or controlling interface for
the group, and certain class-specific messages can be
sent to this interface to act upon the group as a whole. Similarly,
notifications for the entire group can be sent from this
interface but apply to the entire group of interfaces.

\S5.2.3.8 in CDC spec.

@<Class-specific interface descriptor 3@>=
struct {
  U8 bFunctionLength;
  U8 bDescriptorType;
  U8 bDescriptorSubtype;

  U8 bSlaveInterface[SLAVE_INTERFACE_NUM];

  0x06, /* union */
  0, /* number of CDC control interface */
  { @t\1@> @/
@t\2@> 1 /* number of CDC data interface */
@t\2@> } @/
}

@*1 Language descriptor.

This is necessary to transmit manufacturer, product and serial number.

@<Global variables@>=
const U8 lang_desc[]
@t\hskip2.5pt@> @=PROGMEM@> = { @t\1@> @/
  0x04, /* size of this structure */
  0x03, /* type (string) */
@t\2@> 0x09,0x04 /* id (English) */
};

@*1 String descriptors.

The trick here is that when defining a variable of type |S_string_descriptor|,
the string content follows the first two elements in program memory.
The C standard says that a flexible array member in a struct does not increase the size of the
struct (aside from possibly adding some padding at the end) but gcc lets you initialize it anyway.
|sizeof| on the variable counts only first two elements.
So, we read the size of the variable at
execution time in |@<Handle {\caps get descriptor string} (manufacturer)@>|
and |@<Handle {\caps get descriptor string} (product)@>| by using |pgm_read_byte|.

TODO: put here explanation from \.{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51470592/}
@^TODO@>

Is USB each character is 2 bytes. Wide-character string can be used here,
because on GCC for atmega32u4 wide character is 2 bytes.
Note, that for wide-character string I use type `\&{int}', not `\&{wchar\_t}',
because by `\&{wchar\_t}' I always mean 4 bytes (to avoid using `\&{wint\_t}').

@t\hskip2.5pt@> @=PROGMEM@> = STR_DESC(L"TEL");

@*1 Serial number descriptor.

This one is different in that its content cannot be prepared in compile time,
only in execution time. So, it cannot be stored in program memory.
Therefore, a special trick is used in |send_descriptor| (to avoid cluttering it with
arguments): we pass a null pointer if serial number is to be transmitted.
In |send_descriptor| |sn_desc| is filled in.
