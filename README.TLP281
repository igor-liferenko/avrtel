If we use TLP281 board, base station is powered on when microcontroller is disconnected from PC.
This behavior is wrong. Behavior must be analogous to normally open mechanical relay: when
microcontroller is disconnected from PC, base station is not powered; and when
there is signal from PC, base station must be powered on. It is possible to un-invert
TLP281 board by connecting two elements to output: pnp transistor and resistor
(controllable + must go to base of the transistor) and resistor must go to ground, and another end
of resistor must go to collector and it will be new controllable +, and emitter goes to constant +.
Resistor must be 1k. Transistor must be calculated.
