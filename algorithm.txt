How to adjust resistor value depending on telephone type and power supply type:

Disconnect IN pin of DTMF decoder, put some big resistor, say 1K, measure current
in the chain (when off-hook). Current must not exceed 50mA (see PC817 datasheet)
(tested to work OK with 25mA current, but first adjust voltage on resistor as
said below).
Then start adjusting resistor until you get about 4V on it (when off-hook).
If current is too big, one more resistor must be added to the chain.
Then connect IN pin of DTMF decoder. Then check that optocopuler works (D5 LED
must be glowing when off-hook). If optocoupler does not work - current is too
small - lower resistor value, but ensure that DTMF detection
still works (LEDs on DTMF decoder board when pressing keys on handset).
If voltage for DTMF decoder is too small, take another power supply which provides
higher current.
